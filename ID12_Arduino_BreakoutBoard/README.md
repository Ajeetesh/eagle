ID12_Arduino_BreakoutBoard
=====

Simple breakout board for the ID12 RFID sensor to Arduino headers. 

All pins are broken out to jumpers so the board can be used by default in reader mode or can be configured for full use of the chip. 

Sparkfun libraries were used for the base header outline and the ID12 footprint.
