#ID12_Arduino_BreakoutBoard

## Overview
This board is a simple breakout board for the [ID12 RFID sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11827) to Arduino headers. 

## Details
All pins are broken out to jumpers so the board can be used by default in reader mode or can be configured for full use of the chip. 

The [sparkfun eagle libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries) were used for the base header outline and the ID12 footprint.
