#ID12_Arduino_BreakoutBoard

## Overview
This board is a simple breakout board for the [ID12 RFID sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11827) to Arduino headers. 

## Details
All pins are broken out to jumpers so the board can be used by default in reader mode or can be configured for full use of the chip. For funsies a TMS36 Analog Temperature sensor was thrown in. It can be populated or not. Make sure to use the proper capacitors if you do populate it. 

The [sparkfun eagle libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries) were used for the base header outline and the ID12 footprint.
